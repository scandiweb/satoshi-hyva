## Contributing Guidelines

We welcome contributions from the community! By following these guidelines, you’ll help us maintain a high standard of quality and consistency in our project. Please take a moment to review the steps below before submitting contributions.

### 1. **Fork the Repository**

- Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
- Make sure to clone your fork locally.

### 2. **Create a New Branch**

- We follow the Git flow process, so always create a new branch from the `production` branch for your work. Name it descriptively based on the task you're working on (e.g., `feature/add-dark-theme`, `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).
- To create a new branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b branch-name
  ```

### 3. **Make Your Changes**

- Make sure to follow the project's coding standards and conventions.
- Write clear and concise commit messages. Use the present tense and start with a short description (e.g., "Fix bug in user authentication").

### 4. **Test Your Changes**

- Ensure that your changes don’t break any existing functionality.

### 5. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**

- Push your changes to your forked repository:
  ```bash
  git push origin branch-name
  ```
- Open a pull request (PR) against the `production` branch of the original repository.
- Provide a clear description of the changes you've made.

### 6. **Review and Feedback**

- After you submit your PR, our team will review your changes.
- Be open to feedback and ready to make revisions if needed. We encourage a collaborative review process.

### 7. **Additional Notes**

- **Issues:** If you’re not sure where to start or have questions, feel free to open an issue and ask for guidance.
